See hardcodes at top of code where there is, for example, "start_date" and "ndays" 
Note: You may need to adjust the "clevs" to get good range of colors.
Note: You may want to adjust the Basemap resolution to "c" for crude in experiments.
Note: You may need to "conda install -c conda-forge basemap-data-hires" in order to use the higher resolution coastlines

Requires the module "zlconversions.py" which have many functions.
